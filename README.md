# BIEM-Ifc: Automating Energy Simulations in BIM Models

## Overview
Welcome to the BIEM-Ifc repository! This digital tool is at the forefront of integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) models in IFC format with EnergyPlus, the renowned engine for energy simulation. BIEM-Ifc is designed to automate energy simulations, streamlining the process and enhancing accuracy and efficiency in building energy analysis.

## Features
- **BIM and EnergyPlus Integration**: Seamlessly integrates BIM models in IFC format with EnergyPlus for energy simulation.
- **Automated Simulation Process**: Simplifies and automates the workflow for energy simulation in BIM models.
- **XBIM Toolkit Utilization**: Employs XBIM, a powerful toolkit, for managing and extracting information from BIM models.
- **BIM to BEM Interoperability**: Facilitates the development of solutions aimed at BIM to Building Energy Modeling (BEM) interoperability.
